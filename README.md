A little bit about myself...

Hi there,

My name is Teodora but everyone knows me as Teddy. I am originally from Bulgaria but have been living in the United States permanently for the last 10+ years. I like to read books, cook, take pictures, explore new destinations, etc. I am an easy-going person with a great sence of humor, quick lerner and a great teamplayer.
